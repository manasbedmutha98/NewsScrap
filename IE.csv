In the film, the audience will get to see him slipping into a comic character with a poker face. Also, with fewer dialogues, you will get to witness Irrfan emoting more through expressions.~http://images.indianexpress.com/2018/04/blackmail-irrfan-khan-759.jpg?w=759~blackmail, irrfan khan, irrfan, blackmail movie, irrfan khan film, blackmail photos, abhinay deo, irrfan khan photos~blackmail, irrfan khan, irrfan, blackmail movie, irrfan khan film, blackmail photos, abhinay deo, irrfan khan photos~ After much talks around when Abhinay Deo’s quirky comedy Blackmail starring Irrfan Khan and Kriti Kulhari will hit the theatres, Blackmail is releasing this Friday. The film has left cinephiles excited ever since the teaser of it was released by the makers which had National Award-winning actor Irrfan running bare-chested on the streets. Also, the fans of Irrfan who are taken aback after knowing about his health condition want to see their favourite star back in action. The actor has been diagnosed with Neuroendocrine Tumour. Though the director and producer of the film Bhushan Kumar offered to postpone the release, it was Irrfan who was keen on the timely release of Blackmail as it is one of his favourite movies. Here are a few reasons which make Blackmail worth a watch this weekend. 1. Irrfan Khan Whenever the 51-year-old actor has made it to the silver screen, the instances of movie buffs returning disappointed have been minimal. He is an actor who, in his almost three-decades-long career, has portrayed every character with panache and has added a realistic touch to his every role whether be it of Yogi in Qarib Qarib Singlle, Raj in Hindi Medium or Rana Chaudhary in Piku. Now with Blackmail, where he plays a victim of infidelity, we expect nothing less of the actor. The trailer of the film has already established how Irrfan will ace this role as well. In the film, the audience will get to see him slipping into a comic character with a poker face. Also, with fewer dialogues, you will get to witness Irrfan emoting more through his expressions. 2. Abhinay Deo Director Abhinay Deo has films like Delly Belly, a dark comedy and Force 2, a thriller, to his credit and he has also directed Anil Kapoor’s TV series 24 which was received well by the Indian television audience. The director has once again attempted to make a dark comedy with Blackmail, which is a quirky take on adultery. Abhinay’s execution of Delly Belly made the film stand out from the rest of Bollywood in the genre of comedy. He had control over what his characters did in the film and after seeing the trailer of the madcap comedy Blackmail, it seems Deo will have another hit in his kitty. 3. Plot Movies made on the subject of infidelity in the Hindi film industry until now has more or less the same treatment. It goes like the husband or the wife finds out about his/her spouse cheating on them, they go mad in anger and in anger either resort to violent measures like killing one’s partner or choose to divorce their partner. But nothing of the sorts happen in Blackmail. It is a story of a husband Dev (Irrfan) who reaches home from the office to find his wife of seven years Reena (Kirti Kulhari) in bed with Arunodoy Singh’s character. Instead of getting violent, Dev decides to take revenge by blackmailing his wife’s boyfriend. But his blackmailing goes wrong and he is the one being blackmailed. The crazy turn of events in the trailer has left all excited to know what happens to Irrfan’s character in the end, will he succeed in his plan or will have to pay a price for his actions. 4. Supporting Cast Apart from Irrfan Khan and Kriti Kulhari, the film has actors like Divya Dutta, Arunoday Singh, Omi Vaidya, Anuja Sathe, Pradhuman Singh Mall and Gajraj Rao. All of them have proved their acting mettle earlier and have eclipsed the lead of the films they have starred in. With Blackmail too, they are expected to make the film a memorable one with their stellar performance. 5. Celebrity Review The Abhinay Deo directorial has received rave reviews from the film fraternity at the special screening of Blackmail. Amitabh Bachchan, Anil Kapoor, Rajkumar Hirani, Amol Gupte, Nishikant Kamat, Ashutosh Gowarikar, Tanuja Chandra, Meghna Gulzar, Ravi Udyawar, Rensil D’Silva, Sudhir Mishra and others were blown over by the script and the performance of the actors in the dark comedy.

From calling actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui, one of the best actors of Bollywood to comparing him with Shah Rukh Khan and Amitabh Bachchan, the audience has put up some interesting, and even hilarious comments on the trailer's YouTube link.~http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/07/nawaz-7592.jpg?w=759~babumoshai bandookbaaz trailer user reactions, babumoshai bandookbaaz trailer reactions, babumoshai bandookbaaz audience reaction, babumoshai bandookbaaz, babumoshai bandookbaaz trailer, nawazuddin siddiqui, nawazuddin new movie, nawazuddin movies, babumoshai bandookbaaz nawazuddin siddiqui movie~babumoshai bandookbaaz trailer user reactions, babumoshai bandookbaaz trailer reactions, babumoshai bandookbaaz audience reaction, babumoshai bandookbaaz, babumoshai bandookbaaz trailer, nawazuddin siddiqui, nawazuddin new movie, nawazuddin movies, babumoshai bandookbaaz nawazuddin siddiqui movie~ There is no doubt what so ever that Nawazuddin Siddiqui spells magic on-screen every time he makes an appearance. After giving some stellar performances in Gangs of Wasseypur, MOM, Raman Raghav 2.0 and Kahaani, Nawaz is all set to blow away our minds yet again with Babumoshai Bandookbaaz. The trailer for his upcoming flick was released recently and it looks like Nawaz is back in his character from Gangs of Wasseypur. Though Babumoshai Bandookbaaz is chiefly a thriller, the trailer promises the movie to even have an interesting mix of romance and action. The film has sprung into news a year back when Chitrangda Singh had walked out of the movie. When asked about the issues, director Kushan Nandy told reporters, “There were multiple issues with her… She had my script with her for one and a half years. The script was in detail, it had everything specified and even then if someone has any problem, I can’t force anyone.” Bengali beauty Bidita Bag, who replaced Chitrangda, said there was no apprehension in taking over the role and she is doing some powerful scenes in the movie.  While the trailer already has more than 30 lakh views, Nawaz’s fans have also posted some interesting comments on YouTube. One user named, Tarun Mahalawat, says, “Nawazuddin Siddique, Irfan Khan, Manoj Bajpai, Kay Kay Menon, Rajkumar Rao and Ajay Devgan are the best actors of Bollywood currently.” While another Avi Kaushik said, “Nawazuddin u r gonna be d greatest actor of all time in Indian Cinema…after Dilip Kumar n Amitabh Bachchan..!” Another user, Rohit Rohra says “Awesome movie can’t wait overrated khans se toh aachi hi hogi.” Touseef Ashfaq compared Nawaz to Shah Rukh Khan and wrote, “Way better then SRK! way better! Next coming super star hero.every movie of Nawaz is like jewel! not like over acting Ki ki ki ki…ran.( the comment is based on acting..not movie!)” Well, we hope like the amazing response that fans have given to Nawaz, the same is received by the movie too. Babumoshai Bandookbaaz is scheduled to release on August 25. For all the latest Entertainment News, download Indian Express App~~irfan,khan,movie

Now those types of films are being made which parents can show to their children,” he added. Directed by Saket Chaudhary, Hindi Medium is a story about how education that is supposed to be a tool of enlightenment has become a tool to create inequality. It also features Pakistani actress Saba Qamar in the lead. “My experience shooting for Hindi Medium was very smooth. I am thankful to all the students, who cooperated with us during the shooting. When you go to any school, you are reminded of your own childhood days. I really enjoyed shooting for this film,” Irrfan said.

After learning about Irrfan’s illness, Vishal announced, “Irrfan is a warrior and we know he will conquer this battle. Therefore @deepikapadukone, Prernaa @kriarj and I have decided to reschedule our film and start with renewed energy and celebration when our warrior returns as a winner.” Directed by Abhinay Deo, Blackmail also stars Kirti Kulhari, Divya Dutta and Arunoday Singh in pivotal roles. The film heads to the silver screens on April 6. For all the latest Entertainment News, download Indian Express App~NA1~irfan,khan,blackmail

The film has left cinephiles excited ever since the teaser of it was released by the makers which had National Award-winning actor Irrfan running bare-chested on the streets. Also, the fans of Irrfan who are taken aback after knowing about his health condition want to see their favourite star back in action. The actor has been diagnosed with Neuroendocrine Tumour. Though the director and producer of the film Bhushan Kumar offered to postpone the release, it was Irrfan who was keen on the timely release of Blackmail as it is one of his favourite movies. Here are a few reasons which make Blackmail worth a watch this weekend. 1. Irrfan Khan Whenever the 51-year-old actor has made it to the silver screen, the instances of movie buffs returning disappointed have been minimal. He is an actor who, in his almost three-decades-long career, has portrayed every character with panache and has added a realistic touch to his every role whether be it of Yogi in Qarib Qarib Singlle, Raj in Hindi Medium or Rana Chaudhary in Piku. Now with Blackmail, where he plays a victim of infidelity, we expect nothing less of the actor. The trailer of the film has already established how Irrfan will ace this role as well. In the film, the audience will get to see him slipping into a comic character with a poker face. Also, with fewer dialogues, you will get to witness Irrfan emoting more through his expressions. 2. Abhinay Deo Director Abhinay Deo has films like Delly Belly, a dark comedy and Force 2, a thriller, to his credit and he has also directed Anil Kapoor’s TV series 24 which was received well by the Indian television audience. The director has once again attempted to make a dark comedy with Blackmail, which is a quirky take on adultery. Abhinay’s execution of Delly Belly made the film stand out from the rest of Bollywood in the genre of comedy. He had control over what his characters did in the film and after seeing the trailer of the madcap comedy Blackmail, it seems Deo will have another hit in his kitty. 3. Plot Movies made on the subject of infidelity in the Hindi film industry until now has more or less the same treatment. It goes like the husband or the wife finds out about his/her spouse cheating on them, they go mad in anger and in anger either resort to violent measures like killing one’s partner or choose to divorce their partner. But nothing of the sorts happen in Blackmail. It is a story of a husband Dev (Irrfan) who reaches home from the office to find his wife of seven years Reena (Kirti Kulhari) in bed with Arunodoy Singh’s character. Instead of getting violent, Dev decides to take revenge by blackmailing his wife’s boyfriend. But his blackmailing goes wrong and he is the one being blackmailed. The crazy turn of events in the trailer has left all excited to know what happens to Irrfan’s character in the end, will he succeed in his plan or will have to pay a price for his actions. 4. Supporting Cast Apart from Irrfan Khan and Kriti Kulhari, the film has actors like Divya Dutta, Arunoday Singh, Omi Vaidya, Anuja Sathe, Pradhuman Singh Mall and Gajraj Rao. All of them have proved their acting mettle earlier and have eclipsed the lead of the films they have starred in. With Blackmail too, they are expected to make the film a memorable one with their stellar performance. 5. Celebrity Review The Abhinay Deo directorial has received rave reviews from the film fraternity at the special screening of Blackmail. Amitabh Bachchan, Anil Kapoor, Rajkumar Hirani, Amol Gupte, Nishikant Kamat, Ashutosh Gowarikar, Tanuja Chandra, Meghna Gulzar, Ravi Udyawar, Rensil D’Silva, Sudhir Mishra and others were blown over by the script and the performance of the actors in the dark comedy.
