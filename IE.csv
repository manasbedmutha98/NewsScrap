A for Amarinder The numero uno of Punjab Congress swept to power on March 11 in 2017 Assembly elections on the back of voter fatigue with the Badal-run Shiromani Akali Dal. He has had a stickly first year over the government’s slow progress on its big promises, and he has lost a minister to a sand mining scandal. His coterie style of working is a source of complaints from within the party but the charisma of the ex-royal ex-soldier makes up for his inaccessibility, and is the glue that keeps the party together. B for Badals Thrown out of power after a decade, Parkash Singh Badal and son Sukhbir Singh Badal are not lying low. After a crushing poll defeat, reducing SAD to number three position in the House, Sukhbir is keeping up the morale of party cadres. Sukhbir’s series of pol khol rallies has stirred the pot against the Congress but the two parties are still seen as opponents in a “friendly match”. Amarinder is firm on his “no vendetta” stance, and his party workers are unhappy with him for “going soft” on Badals, and Badal brother-in-law Bikram Singh Majithia. Local Bodies and Tourism Minister, Navjot Singh Sidhu, has been at the forefront of an effort to persuade the CM to act tough against the Akalis. C for Cabinet expansion The Cabinet is now reduced to eight after the exit of Rana Gurjit Singh. An expansion has been anticipated at least since July 2017, but has not taken place, giving rise to unrest among aspirants. There has been speculation that the Congress high command and Amarinder are not on the same page regarding finalisation of names. D for Drugs The highlight of the 2017 election campaign, it was the widespread perception that the SAD-BJP government had failed to curb the drug menace that contributed to the stinging defeat of the alliance. Amarinder had promised to wipe out the drugs menace within four weeks of coming to power. A Special Task Force (STF) formed by him has made few big seizures of drugs. In a repeat of the crackdown during SAD-BJP regime, small time peddlers make up most of the arrested. Narcotics continue to be available. Recent studies have shown that there may be anywhere between 2.5 lakh to 3.5 lakh drug addicts in the state. E for Economy Debt ridden Punjab has not shown any visible signs of fiscal recovery in the past one year. Attempted austerity measures have not yielded desired results yet. The situation is not much different compared to the SAD-BJP government. The only difference is that SAD-BJP never admitted the fact of empty coffers, while Congress never tires to point out the legacy of fiscal mess it has inherited. The overwhelming dependence on funds from the centre has been exacerbated by the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) further increasing the cash crunch for the time being. F for Farmers’ suicides Continuing farmer suicides, apparently under the burden of debt, have overshadowed the government’s loan waiver scheme. The watered down loan waiver scheme has prompted the Opposition’s allegation that Congress made false promises while the government counters it citing paucity of funds. G for Goonda Tax The Congress government in Punjab is on the backfoot over an extortion racket outside Guru Gobind Singh refinery in Bathinda. Construction is going on inside the refinery, and truckers carry material to and fro. They are charged a tax and daily collections are pegged at lakhs. The collections have been quickly given the moniker of “goonda tax.” With a cabinet minister’s brother in law being accused of running the racket, the issue reverberated in cabinet besides the opposition taking a dig at the government. Amarinder had to direct police to launch a crackdown. H for Halqa-in-Charge This was job creation by the Akali Dal to keep cadres happy, especially in constituencies where it had lost. Its losing candidate became the HiC, and the district administration and the police took their orders from him or her, completely overlooking the MLA. Congress has not formally adopted the system, but party MLAs and candidates who lost the Assembly election are continuing the system without the nomenclature. I for Industries Attracting new investments in the industrial sector remains a major goal, as well as a challenge. Amarinder has been wooing industry captains in Mumbai to pitch for Punjab as a destination for investment, but without much success. While there have been MoUs signed with many industrial houses, there have been murmurs that single window system of according approval for new projects needs to be streamlined. This was articulated recently by Local Bodies Minister, Navjot Singh Sidhu. J for Jobs ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgar’ was Congress’s catchy election slogan, but in government, the party is discovering that jobs are easier promised than generated. Two government organized job fairs were held in the past year. Private firms were invited to offer employment to qualified youth, but the response from both sides was lukewarm. The low salaries offered by the companies puts off aspirants, and young people want only government jobs. K for Khalistan The K word has made a sudden resurgence in the last year. Law and order agencies’ investigations showed that foreign-based pro-Khalistani elements were involved in targetted killings of Hindu leaders, among others, in Punjab. Amarinder launched a frontal attack on ministers of Indian origin in the Canadian government for harbouring pro-Khalistan sentiments and encouraging the separatists. The CM did not meet the Canadian defense minister Harjit Sajjan when he visited Punjab last year. Earlier, Canada had discouraged a visit by Amarinder to Canada ahead of the Punjab elections. Amarinder cancelled the visit and blamed the Khalistan lobby in Canada for it. To the surprise of many in Punjab, the Centre picked up where Amarinder had left off and the buzz about Khalistanis in Canada peaked during the visit of the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to India. L for Langah, Sucha Singh Akali politician and ex-MLA of Dera Baba Nanak, Langah found himself in hot water just ahead of the 2017 Gurdaspur parliamentary bypoll. A woman in the police department accused him of raping her for the last 20 years, and produced a video as evidence of her claim. Langah was jailed. Though the seat was being fought by a BJP candidate, Akalis as coalition partner were expected to the do the heavy lifting during the campaign. But with Langah behind bars and the episode reverberating through the constituency, Congress candidate Sunil Jakhar won the seat handsomely. Twist in the tale: the rape victim now says she is not the person in the video. M for Mobile phones The Congress’ pre-poll promise has become a favourite joke for Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann who routinely asks youth at his rallies if they are happy with the smart phones they have received, and if they are all viewing Amarinder’s Facebook page on it. Not a single phone has been given out yet. N for Nepotism The appointments for the posts of members in the Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC) and the Information Commissioners were rocked by allegations that Amarinder was favouring his close aides. Despite vociferous opposition from within the party on some of the names and the dissent of the Leader of Opposition, Sukhpal Singh Khaira, the government forced the names through. O for Out of sight, Out of reach The CM’s preference for working out of his residence by converting it into a camp office, and not attending the office in the Punjab Secretariat is the talk of the town. Unlike his predecessor Parkash Singh Badal who used to hold regular meetings in various districts, Amarinder rarely ventures out into the state to meet anyone. The CMs defence is that the multiple security checks in the secretariat make it difficult for people to meet him and they have more hassle-free access to him at his residence. P for Power The government may have made good its promise of giving power to industrial units at Rs 5 per unit but this has left the Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd (PSPCL) in a quandary. The shortfall in revenue to the corporation was to be subsidised by the government which it has failed to do so, for lack of funds. Thus, PSPCL has been forced to take loans to tide over its revenue requirements. The decision to close the thermal plants at Bathinda, followed by Ropar, has also invited criticism from the opposition and plants’ employees. The promise of renegotiating the Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with private power suppliers, entered into by the SAD-BJP government- to ensure low cost of power to the state is also in limbo. Q for Quality of Governance There was an expectation of a sea change in governance with the change in government, but the ground reality is too different. The Technical Education minister, Charanjit Channi, was recently caught on camera deciding transfers by the toss of a coin. Last year, education minister, Aruna Chaudhary, was seen attending a meeting where her husband, a retired government official, was sitting at the head of the table. An ambitious scheme to integrate defence services veterans into the governance matrix, the Guardian of Governance are still in take off mode. Selected veterans are being trained in public administration. Apart from the difficult task, programme has also attracted adverse comments on the legality of appointing such veterans. R for Rana Gurjit Within two months of forming the government, a sand mining scam involving the then Irrigation and Power Minister, Rana Gurjit Singh, a close confidante of the CM, surfaced much to the CM’s embarassment. Even as a commission of inquiry gave Rana a clean chit, there was enough evidence that showed involvement of his companies in the mine auction at which his former employees were successful bidders. Eventually it was the party high command that dictated Rana’s exit from the Cabinet. S for Suresh Kumar Amarinder’s right hand man, Kumar is a retired bureaucrat reemployed by the Chief Minister to serve as his Chief Principal Secretary. Amarinder had virtually left the running of the government to him, but that also brought out the internal wrangling among his coterie when Kumar’s appointment was challenged in the Punjab & Haryana High Court as “extra-constitutional”, and the government failed to contest it adequately. The court struck down the appointment. Eventually, the government appealed the decision. A division bench then upheld Kumar’s appointment. Suresh Kumar is once again ensconced in his office, and his indispensability to the CM still remains the talk of the bureaucracy.. T for Tubewell Meters, Transport Policy A plan to instal power meters on tubewell connections as part of a pilot project is the government’s next big challenge. The move to restrict agricultural power subsidy and replace it with cash transfers is being vehemently opposed by farmers. While government is justifying it necessary to conserve ground water, farmers, long used to the government’s generosity on this front, fear this could be the thin edge of the wedge, and that they will get neither free power nor the subsidy. In the run-up to the 2017 assembly elections, Amarinder had promised to end the “monopoly of the Badals” in the passenger bus transport business. But it has taken the government nearly a year to notify new policy. Government has begun the process to cancel over 3,000 route extensions, diversions, number of trips, and curtailment of trips of bus services belonging to several bus companies, among them 56 major private transport companies. Whether this will end the alleged monopoly of Badals yet remains to be seen even though there are many Congress leaders too likely to be affected. Also, uncertainty looms over the implementation as the Punjab and Haryana High Court has stayed the issuing of notices. U for U-turn Before elections, Amarinder announced it was his last stint as he thought younger persons needed to come and take charge in politics. But after becoming CM, he announced he would consider contesting the next Assembly polls if conditions in the state required him to be at the helm of affairs. His re-consideration came in the backdrop of a perception that two of his cabinet colleagues were positioning themselves as successors. V for Vicky Gounder, VIP Culture Punjab’s most dreaded gangster, Gounder was killed in an encounter in January. He had escaped with five others from Nabha jail in 2016. Four were caught within days or months, but Gounder remained evasive. Worse, he was constantly updating his Facebook profiles with challenges and taunts to the police and other gangsters. Cut to the quick, the police made a determined effort to hunt him down. The police also link gangsters in the state to pro-Khalistan elements abroad as well as Pakistan’s spy agency-ISI-which is trying to use them to revive separatist agenda in the state. This includes reaching out to the families of criminals and asking them to persuade their kin to surrender. After killing Gounder, police have now started asking singers and lyricists to desist from giving voice to songs that glorify violence. Amarinder Cabinet’s first decision was to do away with “VVIP culture”, and within days, the red beacons were dismantled from the official vehicles of the ministers. Such was the power of this symbolic act that it had a cascading effect around the country, and many state governments and the Centre followed suit. But it has proved to be mere tokenism. The platoon of gunmen accompanying each minister, with the exception of Manpreet Badal, still marks out the VVIP from the mere P. W for Water Wars Often hailed as Panian da raakha (saviours of State water) by his supporters due to the Termination of Agreements Act 2004 during his previous stint, Amarinder, after his return to power, stuck to his position that Punjab had no water to share with Haryana. Months after forming the government, he warned that if there was an anti-Punjab verdict by the Supreme Court on the issue of SYL, it could again push Punjab into dark days of militancy. He even held a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to facilitate talks with Haryana for an early solution. X for X-factors There are many. Some could trip up the government, and some could arguably give it a shot in the arm, but they are better left unsaid for now. Y for Yes-men The CM has surrounded himself with an array of advisors and Officers of Special Duty (OSD). Their exact role is not defined and their salaries, perks and privileges are eyebrow raising. Many had stood by Amarinder when he was out of power for 10 years and these posts are rewards. Z for Zero-tolerance CM Zero Tolerance has been the pet punchline of the CM not only on the issue of drugs, but on the issues of corruption and political interference in police functioning as well. But as the above list has made clear, the record is patchy. For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App

Author: Sujatha Gidla
Publisher: HarperCollins
Pages: 312
Price: Rs 500 In her fantastic book, Ants Among Elephants, Sujatha Gidla tells about a great revolutionary — KG Satyamurthy — who played a decisive role in formulating the Maoist Line in India after Charu Mazumdar. The book also talks about Satyamurthy’s sister, Manjula, Gidla’s mother, as well as the rest of the family. Referred to as Satyam in the book, Satyamurthy was also known as Shiva sagar in Telugu literary circles. Interestingly, his Dalit background was not known until he was expelled from the People’s War Group (PWG, now Maoists) in the late 1980s. Born in 1931, he died in utter poverty in 2012. But in his lifetime, he played a key role in the blood-spattered struggles of the Telugu region. At the fag end of his life, he came into the Dalit movement, still uncertain of his conviction in that ideology. I heard about Shiva sagar in the early ’70s, when I was doing my masters in Hyderabad’s Osmania University. His most incendiary poetry book Udhyamam Nelabaludu (The Movement: A One Month Baby) was constantly referred to and quoted from. He was a stellar poet. The early communist movement did not talk about caste and untouchability, as the Gandhians did. Their new line was formulated after they were all expelled from the CPI(M) in 1967. Mahatma Gandhi responded to Dr BR Ambedkar’s bitter critique of caste and engaged with him in a debate on varna and untouchability. But no communist leader seemed to have read Ambedkar’s book, Annihilation of Caste, nor did they respect him. They only respected Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and his writings. Ever since the party was born in 1925, the communist leadership mobilised Dalits under the banner of the red flag and class struggle, but the Brahmin and the Shudra upper caste — Kamma, Reddy — communist leadership refused to look into the history of caste and untouchability. The caste-blind communists forced even a powerful leader like Satyamurthy to hide his background till he was expelled from the PWG. In Gidla’s brilliant narrative of the history of her maternal family, she traces the untouchable roots of the family and its conversion to Protestant Christianity. She tells the world, not just India, how the most poverty-stricken untouchable Dalit family negotiated between the mission-educated Dalits and the brutal and superstitious casteism of the Brahmin, Kamma and Reddy communities in the Krishna-Godavari river basin of coastal Andhra Pradesh. This book also brings out the casteism in Indian Christians, apart from that displayed by the Hindus. Gidla’s modern India has made a multiculturalist journey of castes, religions and education. She narrativises the course of the evolution of modern India through KGS’s story — how he turns into a young communist at the Andhra Christian College of Guntur in the 1940s, and lives like an “ant” (a poverty-stricken Dalit) among “elephants” – upper caste boys and girls, who were rich and felt liberated after the British left. She tells how the girls in his college (mostly Brahmins) admired his artistic talents but abandoned him as he was a Mala (untouchable), when he thought of loving and living with one of them. Many Dalit youths across universities meet with this situation even now and some even commit suicide. Angry at his fate and his maltreatment, starving and burdened by shame, Satyamurthy turns to communism and revolution. He fails in all his exams. He is dismissed from his job at the Visalaandhra, a communist newspaper, when the upper castes within the administration realise that he is a Mala. However, he pursues his revolutionary line and strikes up a friendship with Kondapalli Seetharamaiah (who was from a Reddy family) and carries the revolution on his shoulders. He, along with Panchadi Krishnamurthy (a Kalinga Kapu), started the Naxalite wing of Andhra Pradesh in the presence of Charu Majumdar himself, and extended the Chinese movement for the annihilation of class enemies to Telangana. In the story that Gidla tells with majestic mastery, Satyamurthy does not read Ambedkar at all. Instead, he reads quite a bit of Marx, Lenin and Mao, accessed through Telugu upper-caste writers. His poems reflect their profound influence on him. He was a great sloganeer of the party and was the one who said, “If the gun hurts your shoulder, move it to the other shoulder. But do not put it down.” Satyamurthy was also a master in ridiculing “timid revolutionaries”. His slogan-centred poetry was admired and used by the upper-caste literary figures of the PWG, who had enormous influence on the urban media, till they discovered that he was a Dalit and wanted to put the caste question on the agenda of revolution. His expulsion from the party, and the erasure of his poetry from their mindspace, was done with a vengeance thereafter. The story that Gidla tells in the afterword of the book is familiar — I was introduced to Satyamurthy at the time she describes. Gidla, a physicist by training, a writer by struggle, raises the hope that many such untold stories of India’s Dalits will be put out in a language that the world can understand. There isn’t a single Hollywood film on the history of the marginalisation of 200 million untouchables because there wasn’t a good story about it in English. If Gidla’s first book enables her to make a living from writing, she should resign from her job and write full-time, so that her books can reach the Nobel Prize shortlists. That would internationalise the Dalit question much better than everything that we all tried to do in the Durban Conference of the United Nations in 2001.

Indian Express~Monument at Koregaon~http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/monument-at-koregaon-bhimrao-ambedkar-5007929/~Raja Sekhar Vundru~Maharashtra battlefield is a reminder: Caste stereotypes of valour are misplaced.~http://images.indianexpress.com/2018/01/bhimrao-ambedkar.jpg?w=759~Bhimrao Ambedkar, Bhima-Koregaon war monument, Dalits, British Army, Dalit reservation, casteism, secularism, indian express column~bhimrao ambedkar, bhima-koregaon war monument, dalits, british army, dalit reservation, casteism, secularism, indian express column~ On January 1, 1927, a young Bhimrao Ambedkar visited the Bhima-Koregaon war monument on the banks of the Bhima near Pune with Dalit veterans and serving soldiers of the British Army. He was then celebrating the 109th year of victory of Dalit Mahar soldiers, who formed the majority of the British Army unit that fought against the Peshwas in the battle of Koregaon. This was one of the greatest instances of Dalit martial valour in their time with the British Army. Now, as we mark the 200th anniversary of the battle, it brings political significance and cultural assertion as lakhs of people visited the war monument, rekindling Dalit pride and denouncing inequality. The Battle of Koregaon became a part of folklore, serving as an example of Mahar Dalit valour. Ardythe Basham, in her University of British Columba doctoral thesis (1985), writes: “A small force of 500 men… under the command of Captain F.F. Staunton [who] fought without rest or respite, food or water continuously for twelve hours against a large force of 20,000 Horse and 8,000 Infantry of Peshwa Baji Rao II”. A significant portion of the British Army’s 21st Regiment of the Bombay Native lnfantry, which fought the battle, was comprised of Mahars. The names of the 21 Mahars who died in the battle were etched on the war monument. The battle was a turning point in the third Anglo-Maratha war, and established the British firmly on Indian soil. The battle is a matter of pride for Dalits. The Peshwa rulers imposed the worst social conditions on untouchables, who were ordered to hang a pot around their necks to prevent their spit from falling on the ground, and to wear a broom around their waists to sweep the ground as they moved so they would not “pollute” it. This was depicted well in the 2012-film Shudra: The Rising. The defeat of these rulers was one of the greatest acts of revenge carried out by an oppressed community. The Mahars’ martial valour and military achievements go back to their presence in the armies of Chhatrapati Shivaji. Before 1857, Mahars formed about 25 per cent of the Bombay Army, and were a vital part of the British Marine Battalion. After the 1857 mutiny, the British believed that one of the reasons for the unrest was the inclusion of lower castes in the army. Recruits from the upper castes and the middle-caste peasantry protested the idea of saluting or taking orders from soldiers drawn from untouchable castes. The Vellore mutiny of 1801 and the 1857 mutiny have been documented as caste conflicts. After the 1857 mutiny, and upon the recommendations of the Peel Commission, the British placed a ban on the recruitment of untouchables. Pre-Ambedkarite Mahar leaders repeatedly petitioned the British to reconsider the decision, and in a 1909 petition argued, “that if the government felt that caste prejudice was too deeply ingrained in the army to allow their employment alongside other castes, a separate Mahar company or battalion should be formed to circumvent this caste prejudice as with the Mazhabi Sikhs of the 23rd, 32nd, and 34th Pioneers”. The Mazhabi Sikhs (untouchables who converted to Sikhism) and Dalit Sikhs (Ramdasis and Ravidasis) had been placed in separate regiments to circumvent caste issues. The regiments were specially trained as assault pioneers, and helped the British regain Delhi and Lucknow during the 1857 mutiny. Untouchables made up a significant part of the Madras Army — Malas from Andhra Pradesh were also part of the Madras Army, and enlisted during the First and Second World Wars from Madras Presidency along with the Holeyas of Karnataka, who enlisted with Mahars in the Bombay Army. Ambedkar’s father and six uncles were subedar majors — the highest rank any native Indian could attain in the British Army. He married into an army family. After de-enlistment, Ambedkar used his lineage and knowledge of the sacrifices Dalit soldiers had made to question British apathy. In a booklet distributed in 1930 during the First Round Table Conference in London, Ambedkar wrote, “Who were these people who joined the army of the East India Company and helped the British to conquer India? …the people who joined the Army of the East India Company were the Untouchables of India. The men who fought with Clive in the battle of Plassey were the Dusads, and the Dusads are Untouchables. The men who fought in the battle of Koregaon were the Mahars, and the Mahars are Untouchables. Thus in the first battle and the last battle (1757-1818) it was the Untouchables who fought on the side of the British and helped them to conquer India. The truth of this was admitted by the Marquess of Tweedledale in his note to the Peel Commission which was appointed in 1859 to report on the reorganisation of the Indian Army.” He argued that the Bombay Army of Mahars and Madras Army of Pariahs helped the British quell the 1857 mutiny, and that “nothing can be more ungrateful than this exclusion of the Untouchables from the Army”. Due to Ambedkar’s efforts, a separate Mahar Regiment, similar to that of the Mazhabi Sikhs, was created in 1941. A separate 1st Chamar Regiment was enlisted in 1943. The Mazhabi and Ramdasi Sikh regiments were merged in 1941, and in 1944 renamed as the Sikh Light Infantry. While the Mahar regiment and Sikh Light Infantry continue to serve the Indian nation even today, the Chamar Regiment was disbanded after World War II. Ambedkar’s campaign in the 1930s ensured political rights for untouchables. His campaign and confidence emanated from the great lineage and pride of untouchable valour, fearlessness and sacrifice. The 200-year mark of the battle of Koregaon is just a reminder to the nation that valour and sacrifice don’t belong to a select group of castes.

The translations were the effort of a team of scholars led by M M Kalburgi, the scholar whose murder 2 years ago by fundamentalists was one of the triggers of a massive protest by writers against growing intolerance against free speech in society. Basavanna, who lived in the 12th century in Kalyana in northern Karnataka, is a seminal figure in the Bhakti movement, which challenged the dominance of Brahminical Hinduism, and especially institutions like the caste system, from the 6th century onwards. He was a saint, a social reformer, a poet and a political activist; he was minister to Bijjala, a Kalachurya king who succeeded the Chalukyas and ruled from Kalyana. Under his spiritual leadership, the Veerashaivas, an order of Shiva worshippers that rejected discrimination based on caste and gender, sought to establish an egalitarian social order. The Sharana movement he presided over attracted people from all castes, and like most strands of the Bhakti movement, produced a corpus of literature, the vachanas, that unveiled the spiritual universe of the Veerashaiva saints. H S Shivaprakash, translator of the vachanas into English, writes: “It is rare to come across any literary movement elsewhere which produced (so many poets)… from all sections of the society. The fact that this explosion took place in the caste ridden 12th century Karnataka society, in which all Shudras, untouchables and women were denied the right to literacy, makes the vachana revolution even more amazing. The Sharana movement produced 33 women vachana poets, most of them from the lower strata of the society.” A K Ramanujam described the vachana as not only a spontaneous cry, but a cry for spontaneity. The vachana form predates Basavanna, according to Shivaprakash, who names Madara Chennaiah, a cobbler-saint, as the first vachana poet. The second poet, Dohara Kakkaiah, too was born in an untouchable caste. Very few of the works of these poets have survived while a large collection of vachanas of Jedara Dasimaiah, a weaver by profession, are available. Among the vachanakaras were people from many artisanal communities and untouchable castes. Not surprisingly, kayakave kailsasa (work itself is worship), became almost a theological dictum of the Sharana movement. The egalitarianism of Basavanna’s Sharana movement was too radical for its times. As his fame spread, people flocked to Kalyana to see him. He set up the Anubhava Mandapa, where the Sharanas, drawn from different castes and communities, gathered and engaged in learning and discussions. In Ramanujan’s words, “A new community with egalitarian ideals disregarding caste, class and sex grew in Kalyana, challenging orthodoxy, rejecting social convention and religious ritual.” The gathering storm shook the empire when the Sharanas challenged the final bastion of the caste order: they organised a wedding where the bridegroom was from a lower caste, and the bride a Brahmin. The conservatives and the radicals clashed. Basavanna was forced to leave the palace and the city, and the Sharana movement dispersed before the violence unleashed by the establishment. It never managed to regain its radical, egalitarian edge, though the Veerashaivas, now commonly known as Lingayats, emerged politically powerful in the later centuries. *** The Lingayats, who are estimated to be about 17% of the population, have had immense influence over Karnataka politics. Under leaders like Nijalingappa, who was Karnataka CM for nearly a decade, and B D Jatti, the community rallied behind the Congress. An influential section began to move away from the Congress after the party split in 1969. Nijalingappa stayed with the Congress (O), while Indira Gandhi’s faction under Devaraj Urs, an OBC leader, built a social coalition of OBC castes, Dalits and Muslims, offering empowerment through reservations and land reforms. Urs’s coalition had the numbers to challenge the dominance of the Lingayats, and the other dominant caste, the Vokkaligas. When Janata emerged as a challenger to the Congress, both communities backed it, and the party became a contender for power in the 1980s and 90s. But the split in Janata Dal in the late 90s also resulted in the two communities drifting apart: the Lingayats went to the BJP, then an emerging force, while the Vokkaligas more or less stayed with the Janata Dal, headed by Deve Gowda, a Vokkaliga. The rise of B S Yeddyurappa, a Lingayat, in the BJP in the 1990s cemented the community’s ties with the party. Today, the Lingayats are considered the core vote of the BJP. Political analysts say when Yeddyurappa rebelled against the BJP and floated his own outfit, the Lingayats shifted support, resulting in the party’s defeat in the 2013 Assembly election. Yeddyurappa’s KJP won 10% of the vote, and the BJP presence in the Assembly fell from 121 to 40 seats. Senior CPM leader G N Nagaraj argues that Modi’s invocation of Basavanna is part of the BJP’s outreach to the Lingayats. In the light of Yeddyurappa’s past record and his present tenuous relations with the BJP state leadership, Modi may want to establish direct ties with the community; the party does not want the community’s support to be mediated by one leader. Nagaraj also argues that the Lingayats are not a monolithic community, and it is only the richer sections among them — the business elite, landlords and the priest class — that support the BJP. He calls them the inheritors of a distorted legacy of the Sharana movement — among the distortions are building temples and worshipping Vedic cultures, which, Nagaraj says, are against Basavanna’s basic principles. With Assembly elections due in Karnataka next year, political parties have started to reassess their strengths. The Congress under Siddaramaiah is banking on a social coalition of backward castes, Dalits, Muslims and, possibly, an alliance with the Janata Dal (S), reminiscent of Urs’s strategy. In his recent Budget, he also promised subsidised canteens like the Amma canteens in neighbouring Tamil Nadu. As Siddaramaiah’s political skills square against Modi’s Hindutva politics, the outcome will be keenly watched. Till then, as Basavanna said: “They do not believe, do not trust/But call out in vain/ They do not know how to believe/ These men of the world./Will not Shiva say: ‘Yes’/ To men who merely call out/ But do not believe/ Says Kudalasangama, our father:/ ‘Go on blow your horn, go on crying out.’ For all the latest Explained News, download Indian Express App
